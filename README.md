## 📌 Overview of Tasks

### 🔢 TASK 1: Number Guessing Game

A simple Java console game where the program:
- Generates a random number within a given range (e.g., 1–100)
- Prompts the user to guess the number
- Provides feedback: "Too high", "Too low", or "Correct"
- Limits the number of attempts
- Allows multiple rounds
- Displays a score based on user performance

This program:
- Takes input marks (out of 100) for multiple subjects
- Calculates the total marks and average percentage
- Assigns a grade based on performance
- Displays the total, percentage, and grade
